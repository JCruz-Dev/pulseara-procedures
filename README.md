   <!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## What is covered in the APP

- âœ… When app loads there is a empty message for the user when there is no data on backend.
- âœ… When user clicks "Editar procedimientos" appears a modal with a button to add procedures, close modal, save changes 
- âœ… When user clicks on "Agregar procedimientos" appears a form we can edit and then hit "Guardar cambios" to save the changes on Supabase
- âœ… When modal is closed, we can see the sync of data between the home screen and the modal and it apperas a snackbar called "Procedimiento agregado" when request is success.
- âœ… When there is data and we hit the button "Editar procedmimentos" the current data loads into the modal and we can edit the items or remove them.

Also..
- ðŸŽ¯ We avoid multiple calls to the backend when using the Modal
